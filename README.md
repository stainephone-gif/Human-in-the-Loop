# Human in the Loop

A news game about AI governance, speed, and regulation.

## About the Game

**Human in the Loop** is an interactive news game that explores the tensions between AI innovation, public safety, and regulatory oversight. Players control an AI deployment pipeline and must balance competing priorities while responding to realistic news events.

### Core Concept

The game addresses a central question in contemporary AI journalism:
> How do decisions about speed, control, and regulation shape the social impact of AI?

Rather than presenting AI as inherently good or bad, the game demonstrates that AI outcomes depend on human governance choices, institutional incentives, and trade-offs between competing values.

## How to Play

1. **Open the game**: Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. **Control deployment speed**: Use the slider to adjust how quickly AI systems are deployed
3. **Respond to events**: Real AI news scenarios will appear as cards - choose your response
4. **Monitor indicators**: Keep track of Innovation, Public Trust, Social Stability, and Regulatory Pressure
5. **Manage trade-offs**: Every decision has consequences - there are no perfect solutions

### Game Duration
Each session lasts 3-5 minutes.

### Win Conditions
Maintain balance across all indicators:
- Innovation Index stays above sustainable threshold
- Public Trust doesn't collapse
- Social Stability avoids critical failure
- Regulatory Pressure stays manageable

### Lose Conditions
- Public trust collapses (≤0%)
- Social stability reaches critical failure (≤0%)
- Emergency AI bans triggered (Regulatory ≥100%)

## Key Game Mechanics

### Speed Control
- **Slow**: High safety and trust, but reduced competitiveness
- **Moderate**: Balanced growth with manageable risks
- **Fast**: Rapid innovation but increased risk accumulation

### Risk Accumulation
Unaddressed issues (bias, privacy, labor displacement, safety) accumulate as latent risks. When thresholds are crossed, risks manifest as scandals, backlash, or regulatory crackdowns.

### Event System
Based on real recurring AI news themes:
- AI discrimination and bias
- Privacy concerns and data breaches
- Labor displacement and automation
- Safety incidents and unexpected behavior
- Regulatory proposals and government action
- Breakthrough innovations and opportunities

## Educational Purpose

This game functions as an editorial argument through its mechanics. It:
- Communicates that AI governance involves structural constraints and trade-offs
- Demonstrates how risks accumulate gradually and manifest after widespread adoption
- Shows how speed and oversight are in constant tension
- Promotes media literacy around AI coverage
- Replaces didactic explanation with experiential learning
